## sqlitedb [Unreleased] (planned sqlitedb/v0.1.0)

### Added
- New module `github.com/schuettc/tools-common/sqlitedb`: the family's SQLite
  conventions in one place, from casebook's working-state database, galley's
  ledger index and muster's store. `Open(ctx, path, Options)` with WAL, a 5 s
  busy timeout, one connection, foreign keys (on unless `NoForeignKeys`), files
  `0600` and a `0700` parent directory; `user_version` migrations as `Step`s
  (`func(ctx, *sql.Tx) error`, with `SQL` for plain statements), one
  transaction each; `*NewerError` for a newer database; `AdoptUnversioned` and
  `ErrUnversioned` for existing unversioned databases; `(*DB).Tx` and
  `(*DB).Version`. Pins `modernc.org/sqlite` v1.59.0.

### CI
- New `sqlitedb` job (gofmt, vet, `test -race`, build in the submodule) and a
  `stdlib-only` job that fails if the root module gains a dependency.
